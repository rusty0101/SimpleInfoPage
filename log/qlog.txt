2008/04/29 23:07:24	Added a log 'viewer' that doesn't allow editing at http://www.beresourceful.net/~rusty/conlog/ Unfortunately it does not wrap lines. - Rusty
2008/04/30 00:34:06	Both the log viewer previous entry, and the log updater, refresh their view of the log every 10 min. If needed I can change that. - Rusty
2008/04/30 00:34:45	You will also get the current log every time you submit a log entry. - Rusty
2008/04/30 03:41:22	Also created an elog.php varient that can be used to simply add log entries w/o downloading the whole log. - Rusty
2008/04/30 03:44:12	And updated it so that it would not load qlog.php but just elog.php. - Rusty
2008/04/30 03:45:25	Cleaned up. - Rusty
2008/04/30 03:58:00	Just demonstrating that it is not all that hard to enter some text by using a cell phone - Rusty via boost mobile phone
2008/05/02 21:53:07	Reviewing BeResourceful.net from a link sent by Rusty.  Looks as though it is useful, and relatively easy to deal with.  How do you propose to make it available at the Con? - -Linda
2008/06/18 12:41:53	Need to swap the two files around I think... Colors too I suppose. - Rusty
